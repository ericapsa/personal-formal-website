										<!-- <p>Just an incredibly simple responsive site<br />
										template freebie by <a href="http://html5up.net">HTML5 UP</a>.</p> -->
									</header>
									<p>  I’m a roboticist passionate about building systems that move and think in the real world. 
										My focus is on mechanical design and autonomous system integration, especially for field robotics in space and other challenging environments. 
										I earned my BSE in Mechanical Engineering with a Minor in Computer Science from the University of Michigan, and I’m currently completing my MSE in Robotics at the University of Pennsylvania (graduating May 2025). 
										Outside the lab, I’m a dancer, artist, and violinist—I believe creative expression strengthens my engineering work.

												<h4> F1Tenth Autonomous Racing</h4>
												<p> As part of the ESE 6150: Autonomous Racing course at Penn (a part of <a href="https://roboracer.ai/"> RoboRacer</a>), I developed and implemented planning, perception, and control algorithms for a 1/10th scale autonomous race car using ROS2 in Python. 
													My work included implementing wall following, pure pursuit, SLAM, RRT-based obstacle avoidance, and model predictive control (MPC) algorithms. 
													I tested all systems in simulation using RViz and the F1TENTH Gym, and deployed them onto a physical race car for real-world validation. 
													For the final race, we used an MPC controller tracking an optimally generated trajectory, with dynamic switching to a "follow-the-gap" reactive method to safely avoid other vehicles on the track.
													I will be racing at ICRA 2025 as one of 4 teams that UPenn sent. </p>

												<h4> TRUSSES:
													Temporarily, Robots Unite to Surmount Sandy Entrapments, then Separate </h4>
												<p> I am a mechanical and robotics lead on an ongoing NASA LuSTR-funded robotics project (Grant #80NSSC24K0127), where I design, fabricate, and adapt novel robotic platforms including the Spiral Zipper and 2xRHex (a meter scale legged robotic platform) for the heterogeneous team of robots connected by Spiral Zipper Arms. Using SolidWorks for CAD, I led rapid, iterative prototyping across the entire mechanical development process—leveraging 3D printing, laser cutting, waterjet cutting, and basic machining to manufacture and assemble a majority of the robotic components from scratch. My work includes modifications to the Spiral Zipper’s rotary encoder and limit switch system, full manufacture and assembly of the Spiral Zipper, and mechanical design and fabrication of the 2xRHex robot.

												Beyond design and fabrication, I lead project planning and coordination for a 10+ person hardware team, ensuring timely integration across subsystems. 
												I ran experiments at NASA Ames' SSERVI Lunar Testbed and plan to deploy the system at the White Sands National Park for futher experimentaiton and validation.
												I also contribute significantly to technical writing, with work accepted into top robotics venues, including a Bi-Level Optimization Control Problem Setup accepted to an ICRA workshop and a systems mechanism design paper accepted to ISER. </p>

												<h4> Adaptive and Reactive Controller for F1Tenth Car </h4>
												<p> For my final project in MEAM 6230: Learning And Control For Adaptive And Reactive Robots, I developed a reactive adaptive controller for an F1TENTH autonomous racecar using ROS2, VICON motion capture, and CasADi-based optimization. We used a neural ODE to learn a dynamical system and implemented control using Control Lyapunov and Barrier Functions (CLF/CBF). My team built and tested the ROS2 control nodes, integrated them on the real car, and demonstrated robust trajectory tracking with recovery from perturbations. The system is now being extended to handle dynamic obstacle avoidance. </p>

												<h4> Automated Laser Alignment Tool Design and Control</h4>
												<p> 
													I designed, prototyped, and assembled a custom auxiliary device in SolidWorks to automate laser alignment for the F100 robot. I developed and integrated Python-based motor control software and custom controller logic into the existing production line infrastructure. The system significantly reduced operator touch time by 80% and halved measurement time—and continues to operate on the manufacturing floor more than two years later. </p>

												<h4> Automated Polyacrylamide Gel Casting Machine</h4>
												<p>As part of ME 450: Mechanical Engineering Capstone, I worked with Innovative Research to design a machine that automates the polyacrylamide gel creation process.
													Our team followed a small-scale cradle-to-gate lifecycle analysis and user-centered design approach, collaborating closely with our sponsor company and end-users to ensure the final product addressed real-world needs.
													We began by researching the design context, generating and selecting concepts, and developing detailed user requirements.
													I contributed to all phases of the project, including benchmark research, mechanical design, prototyping, assembly, and validation testing.
													My primary responsibility during the manufacturing phase was the electro-mechanical system and software integration, ensuring smooth operation across hardware and control components.
													I also served as the company liaison, leading all communications with our users and sponsor throughout the project timeline.
													The project culminated in a 50-page technical report and a final poster presentation.
													The completed machine was successfully handed off to Innovative Research, along with a full set of assembly, maintenance, and usage instructions. </p>

												<h4> In-Shoe Force Sensor Design and Testing</h4>
												<p> At the Locomotor Control Systems Lab, I designed and prototyped a compact force sensor casing system in Fusion 360 for use in exoskeleton walking trials. The casing enabled accurate ground reaction force measurements in commercial shoes to support real-world task-switching gait analysis. I led material research, iterative redesign, and assembly—including sensor integration and electrical wiring—for a successful test run. My work improved data quality and expanded hardware accessibility to a broader participant pool. This effort supported a larger NSF-funded study focused on task-invariant, backdrivable lower-limb exoskeletons. </p>
