												<h4> Research Work through <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/locolab/"> LocoLab </a> </h4>
												<p> During the school year, I continued my work at by designing
                          3D printed exoskeleton attachments for sensors. After iterative feedback loops
                          and a couple redesigns, both attachments are being used on the current exoskeleton.
                        Currently, I'm working on modeling and analyzing biomechanical effects of
                        powered lower-limb orthoses in OpenSim and MATLAB. </p>
                        <p> Working at the lab as a full-time student has taught me a couple things:
                        1) How to manage time between school and work commitments,
                        2) Effective communication with an advisor, and
                        3) Grit- and following a project from ideation through quality testing. </p>

												<h4> Presented Exoskeleton Research at SURE Symposium </h4>
												<p> As part of a 12 week program
                        <a href="https://sure.engin.umich.edu/">(Summer Undergraduate Research in Engineering) </a>
                        during the summer of 2021, I worked at
                        <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/locolab/"> LocoLab, </a>
                        an rehabilitative exoskeleton research lab. Here, I
                        helped run human subject experiments to verify if two exoskeleton controllers
                        helped reduce muscle activation during Activities of Daily Living (ADLs).
                        At the end of summer symposium, I presented the research online at the SURE symposium. </p>

												<h4>Learned and Taught Webpage Code</h4>
												<p> When the original lockdown summer hit, I turned to online communities to
                        continue learning. From some friends I found
                        <a href="https://enlight.nyc/">Enlight,</a>
                        and completed a two week bootcamp where I created various online projects
                        to learn HTML, CSS, and JS. After graduating from the class, I came back and mentored
                        three other camps after me. This included hosting onine office hours, reviewing projects, and
                        guiding other students to solve coding issues. </p>

												<p> As a part of the 4-year program I enrolled in my highschool,
												my senior year consisted of internship work with companies
												in the community during the school day. I was the only one
												to have completed two internships. I presented both
												my research at GPI and the design process for my prototype in
												Steelcase during our capstone presentation night!</p>

												<h4>Presented at the SPCC National Conference </h4>
												<p> As the culmination of my research internship with
													<a href="http://www.gpilabs.com">GPI Laboratories</a>
												, my partners and I spent a week in Orlando,
												Florida, presenting alongside PHD and college graduates students.
												Although we didn't win the research poster presentation competition,
												the evaluation committee awarded us with a small monetary prize
												for being the youngest to compete. Staying ontop of our timeline
												to finish the research and creating the poster taught me
											 	a lot about persistence- to keep moving forward while keeping an
												eye on the end of the journey. </p>
